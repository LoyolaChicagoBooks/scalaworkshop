Source Code Repositories
----------------------------

The following table contains links to direct download the source code for all of the long examples in our tutorial. We note
that shorter, interactive sessions shown in the tutorial (especially the ones meant to be done simultaneously by the reader)
are not in any repository. You must copy/paste to try them out on your own!

The following table contains links to the source code repository (usually Bitbucket but sometimes GitHub). You will need to
be fluent with version control clients (e.g. ``hg`` or ``git``) to check out the code from these repositories.

.. note::

   This option is recommended for experts only!

Alternately, you can clone https://bitbucket.org/sigcse2013scala/notes and run the ``fullmake.sh`` script, which will 
pull all examples (assuming ``hg`` is installed on your computer) into the ``examples`` subdirectory.
