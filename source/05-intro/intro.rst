About Scala
===============

"Scala is an object-functional programming and scripting language for general
software applications, statically typed, designed to concisely express
solutions in an elegant, type-safe and lightweight (low ceremonial) manner.
Scala has full support for functional programming (including currying, pattern
matching, algebraic data types, lazy evaluation, tail recursion, immutability,
etc.). It cleans up what are often considered poor design decisions in Java
(such as type erasure, checked exceptions, the non-unified type system) and
adds a number of other features designed to allow cleaner, more concise and
more expressive code to be written." [ScalaWikipedia]_

Scala has no connection to *La Scala* or *Teatro alla Scala* (the world
renowned opera house in Milan), but we (especially Dr. Thiruvathukal) love the
name because it addresses the traditions of programming languages and scalable
computing, while *La Scala* is the title of one of his favorite jazz piano
albums by Keith Jarrett, who often names his concerts by the venues where he
performs. [LaScalaConcert]_

We'd like to think that the Scala language represents the design ideal of being
"small and beautiful" but also great for computer science and practical problem
solving. We hope you agree!

Why Scala?
---------------

Scala appeared on the programming language landscape in 2004 and has had a stable presence among the top 20 languages for over a decade.

Technology Radar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thoughtworks maintains a resource known as the Technology Radar [TWTechRadar]_, which uses four classifications for items in various categories, including languages and frameworks:

- Adopt
- Trial 
- Assess
- Hold


Scala has been listed under *Adopt* since `October 2012. <https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar/languages-and-frameworks/scala-the-good-parts>`_
