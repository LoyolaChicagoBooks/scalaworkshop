Source Code Repositories
----------------------------

The following table contains links to GitHub source code repositories for all of the long examples in our tutorial. 
You will need to have basic knowledge of version control using ``git`` to check out the code from these repositories.
We note that shorter, interactive sessions shown in the tutorial (especially the ones meant to be done simultaneously by the reader)
are not in any repository. You must copy/paste to try them out on your own!
