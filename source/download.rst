Source Code Repositories
----------------------------

You can download all of the longer code examples (short inline examples can be copied and pasted from the HTML version) 
individually. You will either need to use Mercurial (hg client) or downlaod the Zip from the URLs below.

.. csv-table:: Repositories
    :header: "Provider", "Description", "URL"

    "hg","integration-scala","https://bitbucket.org/loyolachicagocs_plsystems/integration-scala"
    "hg","lcs-systolicarray","https://bitbucket.org/loyolachicagocs_plsystems/lcs-systolicarray-scala"
    "hg","hpjpc","https://bitbucket.org/loyolachicagocs_books/hpjpc-source-java"
    "hg","introcs-scala-examples","https://bitbucket.org/loyolachicagocs_books/introcs-scala-examples"
    "hg","numerical-explorations-scala","https://bitbucket.org/loyolachicagocs_plsystems/numerical-explorations-scala"

Alternately, you can clone https://bitbucket.org/sigcse2013scala/notes and run the ``fullmake.sh`` script, which will 
pull all examples (assuming ``hg`` is installed on your computer) into the ``examples`` subdirectory.
