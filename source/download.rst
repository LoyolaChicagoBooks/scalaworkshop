Code Examples

- Our Mercurial repository (hosted at https://bitbucket.org/sigcse2013scala/notes) contains the source used to build this tutorial.

- Instructions for how to build this tutorial and get *all* of the code examples can be found via this page.

- Our build scripts automatically pull down all needed code from various repositories maintained by the authors. We are a *distributed* group, so our code examples are everywhere. This project is actually an attempt to aggregate the various examples in a pedagogically suitable package.
