Collections
---------------------
- Just for Scala
- Doesn't make sense before loops in most languages.
- One mutable, one immutable
- Many standard methods
- Many higher-order methods
- Syntax
- Use () for indexing
- List also have ML style operations
- Creation, pass-by-name


Case Classes
---------------

- Immutable struct in simplest usage
- Simple syntax for grouping data
- Works as a pattern
- Copy method

GUIs
------

- scala.swing wraps javax.swing
- Cleaner beginner syntax
- No explicit inheritance
- Reactions use partial functions
- Drawbacks: Currently no JTree, Tables complex, Button syntax uses companion object
- Full Java2D
- Really using Java
- Override paint method
- Events for animations
- Keyboard, Mouse, Timer

CS2
-------

- Pure OO
- Fewer quirks than Java
- Powerful type system
- Traits
- Rich collections
- Libraries again
- Can make things interesting/relevant
- Multithreading and networking
- Eclipse (maybe) and IntelliJ (our favorite)
- Scalable language
- Libraries as language
- Special methods
